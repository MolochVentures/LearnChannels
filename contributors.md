**\* A note about Moloch Ventures:** Moloch is a decentralized autonomous organization intended to foster collaboration and open source practices among state channel researchers and implementers. Moloch is _not_ a parent organization or a traditional venture fund. It is aimed at fostering collaboration within the industry. A white paper and smart contracts are forthcoming.
