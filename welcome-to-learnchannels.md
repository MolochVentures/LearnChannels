# Welcome to LearnChannels

If you ended up here, you’re probably interested in learning about state channels, a method for enabling cheap, fast transactions on Ethereum.

We started LearnChannels because the existing information about state channels is spread all over the place. We wanted to gather all of that information in a single place and make it much easier for someone to browse. At the same time, we found that there isn’t very much easy-to-understand learning material about state channels. Inspired by LearnPlasma, our goal is to make state channels approachable for developers and laymen alike.
